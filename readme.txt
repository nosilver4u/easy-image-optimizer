Easily speed up your website to better connect with your visitors. Properly compress and size/scale images. Includes lazy load and WebP auto-convert.

== Description ==

Want to get more visitors and customers? Easy Image Optimizer allows you to quickly and easily speed up your website so that you can connect with more people.
One-click activation enables you to optimize your images by efficiently encoding and properly sizing images. It also includes lazy loading to defer offscreen images and automatic WebP conversion for even more speed.

Easy Image Optimizer will optimize your site automatically by replacing all your image URLs with cloud-based URLs to deliver your content as fast as possible.
Beyond image optimization, it will also speed up the delivery of your CSS, JS (JavaScript), and font resources, by minifying them and delivering them through a speedy CDN (Content Delivery Network).
