# Contributing to Easy IO

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## Code of Conduct

Someday, we'll have something more substantial. For now, let's keep it simple:

* Be nice, you'll catch more flies with honey (or something like that)
* Do not file an issue to ask for support. Issues are for bugs and feature requests, but if you have a question, you can [contact us](https://ewww.io/contact-us/) directly.
* Do not issue a pull request without submitting an Issue first.

## Coding Standards

All PHP code submitted must follow the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards), specifically the Core ruleset. All commits are automatically tested for this, but it helps if you know what the [rules are](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/). JS and CSS code is honestly a bit unruly at this point.

## Reporting Issues

When you submit a bug:

* Include as much detail as possible. If you're not sure about something, include it anyway.
* Include steps to reproduce the issue, in as much detail as possible, including other plugins/themes that are involved, and settings that may affect the bug.
* Explain what behavior you expected to see, and point out exactly what you saw instead that was not expected.
* If applicable, provide screenshots.
* Provide links to images/pages that you've used to reproduce the issue.
* Enable Easy IO's debugging option and provide as much of it as possible.
* Check older versions to see if it is a regression. You can download them from the [Advanced section at wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-image-optimizer/advanced/).
